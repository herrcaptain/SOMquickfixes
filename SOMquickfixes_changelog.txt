Changelog:

2016-03-24:

-Fixed emissary obsolete tech so it becomes obsolete with optics rather than banking. This avoids a potential gap where no diplomatic units can be produced.
-Added upgrade path to UNIT_BA_CELT_PICTISH_WARRIOR. Now upgrades to UNITCLASS_LONGSWORDSMAN like UNIT_CELT_PICTISH_WARRIOR
-Added missing free promotions to UNIT_BA_CELT_PICTISH_WARRIOR as in UNIT_CELT_PICTISH_WARRIOR
-Fixed building requirement for Aqueduct System. Was incorrectly requiring Gristmill, now correctly requires Plumbing Network in all cities.
